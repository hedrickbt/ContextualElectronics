Resistor Equation
Within the TPS6303X family there are fixed and adjustable output voltage versions available. To properly
configure the fixed output voltage devices, the FB pin is used to sense the output voltage. This means that it
must be connected directly to VOUT. At the adjustable output voltage versions, an external resistor divider is
used to adjust the output voltage. The resistor divider must be connected between VOUT, FB and GND. When
the output voltage is regulated properly, the typical value of the voltage at the FB pin is 500mV. The maximum
recommended value for the output voltage is 5.5V. The current through the resistive divider should be about 100
times greater than the current into the FB pin. The typical current into the FB pin is 0.01 μA, and the voltage
across the resistor between FB and GND, R2, is typically 500 mV. Based on those two values, the recommended
value for R2 should be lower than 500kΩ, in order to set the divider current at 1μA or higher. It is recommended
to keep the value for this resistor in the range of 200kΩ. From that, the value of the resistor connected between
VOUT and FB, R1, depending on the needed output voltage (VOUT), can be calculated using Equation 1:

R1 = R2 * (( Vout/Vfb ) - 1 )


Inductor equations
INDUCTOR SELECTION
To properly configure the TPS6303X devices, an inductor must be connected between pin L1 and pin L2. To
estimate the inductance value Equation 2 and Equation 3 can be used.
3.3v / 0.150A output

buck
L1 = ( Vin1 - Vout ) * 0.5 * uS/A

boost
L2 = Vout * 0.5 * uS/A

In Equation 2 the minimum inductance value, L1 for step down mode operation is calculated. VIN1 is the
maximum input voltage. In Equation 3 the minimum inductance, L2 , for boost mode operation is calculated. The
recommended minimum inductor value is either L1 or L2 whichever is higher. As an example, a suitable inductor
for generating 3.3V from a Li-Ion battery with a battery voltage range from 2.5V up to 4.2V is 2.2 μH. The
recommended inductor value range is between 1.5 μH and 4.7 μH. In general, this means that at high voltage
conversion rates, higher inductor values offer better performance.

With the chosen inductance value, the peak current for the inductor in steady state operation can be calculated.
Equation 4 shows how to calculate the peak current I1 in step down mode operation and Equation 5 shows how
to calculate the peak current I2 in boost mode operation.

I1 = Iout/0.8 + (Vout * (Vin1 - Vout))/(2 * Vin1 * f * L)

I2 = ((Vout * Iout)/(0.8 * Vin2)) + ((Vin2 * (Vout - Vin2))/2 * Vout * f * L)

In both equations f is the minimum switching frequency. VIN2 is the minimum input voltage. The critical current
value for selecting the right inductor is the higher value of I1 and I2 . It also needs to be taken into account that
load transients and error conditions may cause higher inductor currents. This also needs to be taken into account
when selecting an appropriate inductor. The following inductor series from different suppliers have been used
with TPS6303x converters:

Output Capacitor
For the output capacitor, it is recommended to use small ceramic capacitors placed as close as possible to the
VOUT and PGND pins of the IC. If, for any reason, the application requires the use of large capacitors which can
not be placed close to the IC, using a smaller ceramic capacitor in parallel to the large one is recommended.
This small capacitor should be placed as close as possible to the VOUT and PGND pins of the IC.
To get an estimate of the recommended minimum output capacitance, Equation 6 can be used

Cout = 5 * L * uF/uH

A capacitor with a value in the range of the calculated minimum should be used. This is required to maintain
control loop stability. There are no additional requirements regarding minimum ESR. There is also no upper limit
for the output capacitance value. Larger capacitors will cause lower output voltage ripple as well as lower output
voltage drop during load transients.

Buck
R1 = R2 * (( Vout/Vfb ) - 1 )
R1 = 200000 * (( 3.3/0.5 ) - 1 )
R1 = 1.12M or let's go to 1.2M

We want a 1.2M for R2 so...
1200000 = R2 * (( 3.3/0.5 ) - 1 )
1200000 = R2 * (( 3.3/0.5 ) - 1 )
R2 = 214K - let's say 215K

Constant = uS/A
L1 = ( Vin1 - Vout ) * 0.5 * uS/A
L1 = ( 4.2 - 3.3 ) * 0.5 * uS/A
L1 = ( 0.9 ) * 0.5 * us/A
LI = 0.45 * us/A

L2 = Vout * 0.5 * uS/A
L2 = 3.3 * 0.5 * uS/A
L2 = 1.65 * uS/A

I1 = Iout/0.8 + (Vout * (Vin1 - Vout))/(2 * Vin1 * f * L)
I1 = 0.1A/0.8A + (3.3V * (4.2V - 3.3V))/(2 * 4.2V * 2.2mhz * 2.2uh)
I1 = 0.125A + (3.3 * .9)/(2 * 4.2V * 2.2mhz * 2.2uh)
I1 = 0.125A + (3.3 * .9)/(2 * 4.2V * 2.2mhz * 2.2uh)
I1 = 0.125 + (2.97)/(2 * 4.2V * 2200000hz * 0.0000022h)
I1 = 0.125 + (2.97)/(41.624)
I1 = 0.19635A


I2 = ((Vout * Iout)/(0.8 * Vin2)) + ((Vin2 * (Vout - Vin2))/2 * Vout * f * L)
I2 = ((3.3 * 0.100)/(0.8 * 3.0)) + ((3.0 * (3.3 - 3.0))/2 * 3.3 * 2.2mhz * 2.2uh)
I2 = ((3.3 * 0.100)/(0.8 * 3.0)) + ((3.0 * (3.3 - 3.0))/2 * 3.3 * 2200000hz * 0.0000022h)
I2 = (.33/2.4) + (0.9/31.944)
I2 = 0.16567A

Cout = 5 * L * uF/uH
Cout = 5 * 2.2uH * uF/uH
Cout = 5 * 2.2uF
Cout = 11uf - call it 10uf

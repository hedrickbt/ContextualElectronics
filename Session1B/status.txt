Test by probing the DAC OUT test point .128v down to 0v.  You can also put an oscope on pin 10 and watch the pwm
signal.  Duty cycles values will be 0, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%

Module 6	Unit 10 	PWM Testing  : after minute 20
Test by putting an ammeter on fan+ / fan- ( edge terminals 4,5 from green )
Using the mcp4801_pwm_test program, you should see .127a, .095a, .063a, .031a, 0a for the corresponding V levals at the DAC OUT
test pad.  I used Rigol meter to measure current on the A setting, not mA.

Module 6	Unit 14 	Power Monitoring : Test voltages
TEST: V+_ADJ at screw terminals should range from about 10.4v - 1.25v by using the FE+ adjust variable resistor 
( farthest from pc power connector ). At the same time, R30 should range in voltage from 2.6v - 0.313v.  
This is due to the 4:1 ratio created by the 3K and 1K resistor divider.

Module 7	Unit 2 Q3 Testing : Run test program 5_test_fan_pwm_mod_07_unit_02 / fan_pwm_test
TEST: Measure ohms across R16 while running.  Should hit 1ohm for about 2 seconds and then close to 
0ohms for 8 seconds.  Our program keeps Q3 on for 8 seconds and off for 2 seconds.  You can also measure
across the Drain and source of Q3.  You should see 17ohms for 2 seconds and 4K ohms for 8 seconds.  The
DAC out test point should measure 0v as we set the mcp value to 0 in the test program.  Also if you measure
Fan+/- out from the terminal connectors, you should see close to 0mah.

DONE board 1,2,3 : after 14:44 in video
Module 7	Unit 2 Q3 Testing : Run test program 5_test_fan_pwm_mod_07_unit_02/fan_pwm_test_with_dac
TEST: The DAC out test point should measure .064v as we set the mcp value to 0 in the test program.
Also, pin 8 of the dac should measure about .064v.  The Q3 large solder pad should measure .063v
when fan mode is LOW(2 sec) and 0v when FAN MODE is high (8 sec).  If you measure Fan+/- out from 
the terminal connectors, you should see about 20 mah when FAN MODE is LOW ( 2 sec) and 
130mah when FAN MODE is HIGH (8 sec).
NOTE: If you aren't seeing anything at the DAC OUT, make sure you are doing your analogWrite for the 
FAN PWM inside the loop.  PWM didn't work right for me by just setting in setup().

With FAN_OUT+ and FAN_OUT-, from terminal block, connected to the PC FAN, run test program 
5_test_fan_pwm_mod_07_unit_02/fan_pwm_test_with_dac_pc_fan_connected.  The PC FAN should be on for 8 seconds ( FAN MODE
 HIGH ) and off for 2 seconds ( FAN MODE LOW )


4.9.2015
DONE board 2 - may need to revert
Changed R15 from 3k to 1k.  Problem I am having is that the opamp is only outputting .6v on pin 7.  This isn't enough to turn the q4 gate on.

I did revert.

4.25.2015
After lots of testing and creating a list of node voltages, it was determined Q4 was bad.  Once I replaced it and hooked a fan up to Fan+ and
Fan-, now the fan speed varies!!  Q4 was dead on all 3 board.  I used this mosfet testing guide to evaluate the fets I removed:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBJGOOTEwfU.  All 3 were bad the was voltage on black/source to red/drain without touching red to gate.  Also,
there as very little body diode drop.  Something like .001V vs .5-.6V.

There is another issue.  The board I was doing all of my testing on (2) see the A value increase on FAN+ / FAN- as PWM values decrease.  Boards
1 and 3 see the values increase as PWM increases.  I believe boards 1 and 3 are correct.  By decreasing the PWM, we should be "stealing" less
voltage through Q2 thus letting more A through.  Now to figure out the differences.

4.25.2015
Board two had R58 soldered in ( 0 ohm ).  Removed, it didn't help

4.25.2015
Found a differenc R16 was 1K on boards 3.  On board 1,2 it is the correct value of 1 ohm!  Didn't help

4.25
Just noticed that the dac out test point, on board 2, is around 5V when it should be .0830V or so.  Board 1 and 3 are at the .0830V value.

4.25.2015
Got it.  Q2 was shot.  I replaced it with a new one.  Red source to Black Drain read about 0.6V on new fet.  On the one I replaced, 
it read Open ( out of circuit in both cases )!

Now, boards 1,2,3 increase the A at FAN+ FAN- as PWM decreases!  Finally!

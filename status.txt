RE: http://contextualelectronics.com/roll-with-it/power-swap/looking-at-inductor-waveforms/ 
    Check the inductor waveforms 
    Chris was able to get 450mah at 4.49 volts.  I am seeing 210-250mah at 5.5-3.3v

Test powerswap 
* Make sure to take FLIR 
* Look at switching waveform 
* Look at using gabotronics for voltage readings in/out 
* Test using the lipo for the PS 
* Check for .5v/.5014v at FB? testpoint 
* Put a load ( current sink or swim / dc load )

More on thermistor

Chip supports a 10K NTC thermistor which we have stuffed as a plain 10K. For people who require temperature monitors (using high charge rates), remove the 10K and solder in the thermistor in its place

JST connector I ended up with - NOT through hole.  I haven't had any issues with the Adafruit boards that aren't through hole.

The linear regulator inhibit pin was hooked to ground via a 0 ohm resistor. It needs to be hooked to power. Good thing it was hooked through a 0 ohm resistor!
The threshold (Vref) circuit requires that you remove the bottom resistor so that the potentiometer and the other (10K) resistor can form a proper divider (between 1.5V and 3V)
Chris did not add pullup resistors to the output of the LM339, so those need to be installed for it to work. 10K will probably work better than 1K.

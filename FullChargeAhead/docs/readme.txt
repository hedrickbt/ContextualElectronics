Look into an1149 app note to determine if it is a good fit.  Does it even apply to our chip, mcp73834?



Batteries 
==============
http://www.adafruit.com/products/258
The Adafruit 1200mah battery should be charged at 500mah or less unless you trust the thermistor

For batteries less than 500mah, stick with 100mah charge rate.  Greater size, 500mah charge rate

discharge is .5C or .5 * 1200mah = 600mah
